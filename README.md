Lettuce-Farmer
==============
A Sublime Text 2 plugin that provides syntax highlighting, step completion, and
[SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter) style step
validation.

The intention of this plugin is to ease the use of Lettuce for BDD and hopefully
make it simple enough for non-engineers to write feature files. At least that's
the hope.


Installation
============
Using Package Control:
----------------------
[Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) is by far
the easiest way to install Lettuce-Farmer. Once you have Package Control
installed and SublimeText2 restarted, select Package Control (Sublime Text 2 >
Preferences > Package Control) and then 'Install Package'. Once they package
list comes up you can browse for or type 'Lettuce-Farmer'.

Using Git:
----------
Clone the Lettuce-Farmer repository in your Packages directory. You can find
where the directory via Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Browse Packages...

    git clone https://github.com/kylederkacz/lettuce-farmer.git


Shout Outs
==========
The Lettuce Farmer syntax highlighting is primarily based on npverni's
[cucumber-sublime2-bundle](https://github.com/npverni/cucumber-sublime2-bundle).
